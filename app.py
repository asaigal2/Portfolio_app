        I had the incredible opportunity to work individually at the Medical Physics X-Ray Imaging (MOXI) lab, where I focused on  quantifying the levels of endogenous Protoporphyrin-IX (PPIX) in the pores of the skin. This work is critical for enhancing the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy (PDT), a treatment modality for various skin conditions and cancers.
        During this project, I employed **MATLAB extensively for data processing and analysis.** MATLABs robust capabilities in image processing allowed me to apply various filtering techniques to enhance and isolate relevant features in the skin images.
        One of the key methodologies I utilized was **machine learning, specifically k-means clustering**. 
        By clustering pixels based on their intensity and color features, I could distinguish areas with high concentrations of PPIX from those with lower levels.
        To ensure the reliability and **statistical significance of my findings, I conducted t-tests**.
        These statistical tests helped compare the PPIX levels before and after the application of treatments, determining the efficacy of the interventions.

                     My research focused on identifying optimal strategies by categorizing game positions as either P-positions, where the previous player can force a win, or N-positions, where the next player has a winning strategy.
                     Through **recursive analysis and strategic evaluation**, I explored how players can navigate these complex configurations to force their opponents into disadvantageous positions, ultimately leading to a win. This experience enhanced my understanding of **advanced mathematical concepts** and their applications in game theory,

    During my independent study, I focused on leveraging **neural network technologies** to enhance medical imaging, particularly in challenging environments where noise-free data is scarce. My research project, inspired by the "Noise2Noise" framework from Nvidia, aimed to develop a neural network denoiser capable of training with noisy datasets typical of clinical settings. Specifically, I applied this methodology to Fluorescence Guided Surgery (FGS), a crucial technique in modern surgical procedures that relies on fluorescent markers to distinguish between healthy and diseased tissues. The inherent noise in FGS imagingâ€”stemming from shot noise, camera sensor imperfections, and laser leakage lightâ€”compromises image clarity and surgical precision. To address these challenges, 
                I created custom datasets augmented with synthetic noise, allowing the neural network to learn denoising under realistic conditions. The training loop integrated these noise-augmented frames, enabling the model to predict clean states from noisy inputs. This approach not only aimed to enhance practical deployment in healthcare but also contributed to the broader understanding of **noise modeling and machine learning theory**. 
                The project's success in improving image clarity has significant implications for better surgical outcomes and the adoption of advanced imaging techniques.
